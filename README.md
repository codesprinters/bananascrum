Banana Scrum - a Rails based Scrum tool

This is the software that was powering the online Banana Scrum (www.bananascrum.com) 2008-2015 in the single-domain version (it was also sold as a standalone, compiled EJB tool for hosting in enterprise environments). It is now open sourced - feel free to download, use and develop it further. 

The online Banana Scrum has been shut down on Dec 29th 2015 and is not going back. All data from user accounts was preserved and could be obtained from us until May 2020. Now it has been removed and can not be recovered. 

*Be aware that his code was not modified since 2015. This means that it is very likely that is not secured, as new vulnerabilites have been since discovered in tools & libraries we used. Any use is at your own risk. We don't offer any support whatsoever for this project anymore.*
